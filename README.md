# LeetCode Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to LeetCode problems.

## Motivation

The primary goal of this repository is to document my journey of solving LeetCode problems. By sharing my solutions and explanations, I hope to contribute to the learning and understanding of algorithms and data structures among the programming community.

## Structure

The repository is organized into folders based on the problem categories provided by LeetCode. Within each category folder, you'll find subfolders named after specific problem IDs. Each subfolder contains the solution file (usually named `index`) and a README.md file providing the problem description, my approach to solving it, and any additional notes or insights.

## Contribution

If you find any issues with my solutions or have suggestions for improvements, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. I'm always open to feedback and collaboration!

## Disclaimer

While I strive to provide accurate and efficient solutions, please note that there may be multiple approaches to solving a problem, and my solutions may not always be the most optimal. I encourage you to explore different solutions and techniques to deepen your understanding of problem-solving.
